# SHATTERED-Dev-4
The 4th dev release of the indie game I am working on
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Compilation
See first dev release for compilation
## Notice
Shattered is very early in development and, while I have plans for this game, I am only going to release the source code and not the storyline or future plans for the game until development concludes.
## Changes
There can now be multiple enemies at once. I tweaked the movement system for the enemies slightly so that they don't overlap and merge into one entity. (It kind of creeped me out)
